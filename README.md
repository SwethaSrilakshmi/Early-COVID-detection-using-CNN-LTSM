# Early-COVID-detection-using-CNN-LTSM

COVID 19 is an infectious disease that has had a huge negative impact on mankind. Early detection of COVID-19 could help in reducing the impact caused. My project  COVID-19 detection using CNN-LSTM focuses on building a hybrid model where the cough samples in the form of Spectrograms are processed by the CNN and the output of the CNN model is fed to LSTM giving a highly accurate prediction system.

We have implemented initial model to predict COVID. We are actively doing research and working on the model to improve its accuracy.
